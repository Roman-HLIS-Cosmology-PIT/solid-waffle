============

Overview
--------

**solid-waffle** is a repository designed for analysis of correlations in HxRG flats, with an assortment of other features. The repository contains scripts, configuration files, and utilities to support the characterization of HxRG detectors.

*Nota bene*\ :  These scripts are not ready for "black box" use in the sense that unanticipated defects in different detectors can cause issues in the stability of the characterization.  Some work and testing is required before given results can be trusted.  Manual masking is required in some cases, and we are working towards getting this code more streamlined and user-friendly in that regard. Please approach with caution and reach out to the `contacts <#contacts>`_ listed below for help.

Files Description
-----------------


src/solid_waffle/correlation_run.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* **Purpose**\ : Main script to call that takes a config file as an argument and runs the analysis.
* **Key Features**\ :

  * Detector characterization at basic and advanced levels, including nonlinearity and Brighter-Fatter Effect (BFE)
  * Hot pixel identification and calculation of interpixel capacitance (IPC)
  * Summary statistics in superpixels
  * Visualization such as maps of gain, IPC, BFE over superpixels
  * *If visible light data is supplied as well*: Estimates for charge diffusion covariance and quantum yield, also summarized and visualized in outputs

src/solid_waffle/pyirc.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Purpose**\ : Main utility script containing many functions to load in data, calculate statistics, and estimate corrections.
* **Details**\ : Includes functions that will read the data in, compute reference pixel corrections, compute gain, do basic characterization, calculate correlations of neighboring pixels, compute BFE coefficients, and more.

src/solid_waffle/ftsolve.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Purpose**\ : Routines for modeling Fourier-domain correlations across time (Feudenburg et al. 2020).

src/solid_waffle/spr_reduce.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Purpose**\ : Analysis of single pixel reset data.
* **Key Features**\ : 

  * Extraction of spatially varying IPC maps from single pixel reset data.

Directories Overview
--------------------

sample_configs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Description**\ : Sample configuration files.
* **Key Files**\ :

  * example_config_wfirst_h4rg_18237: A sample configuration file which is simplified to the basics. This config requires only flat files, dark files, a format code, time frames, and an output location to be specified.

  * config.vis-sim, config.vis1: Example configuration files for visible light characterization.

  * ex_sim_config: Example configuration for the flat simulator. Run with ``python -m solid_waffle.flat_simulator.simulate_flat ex_sim_config``

src/solid_waffle/flat_simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* **Description**\ : Scripts and utilities for simulating flat field images.
* **Key Files**\ :

  * simulate_flat.py: Main script to generate a simulated flat field.

  * detector_function.py: Some utility functions called by simulate_flat.py

notebooks
^^^^^^^^^


* **Description**\ : Jupyter notebooks for development, analysis, and visualization. None of these are particularly well described currently.
* **Key Notebooks**\ :

  * plotting_tests.ipynb: Shows some visualizations of outputs.

projects
^^^^^^^^

* **Description**\ : Other projects related to detector characterization that aren't in the main workflow right now (and aren't part of the installable module).
* **Key Sub-Folders**\ :

  * crnl_tools: Tools for the "direct method" count-rate non-linearity ground test data.

  * speckle: Tools for speckle fringe data.

How to Get Started
------------------

Running the code requires python modules such as numpy, scipy, astropy, matplotlib, and fitsio, although note that we have not extensively tested this across different python versions and cannot guarantee everything will run smoothly.


#. The code expects input flats and darks in FITS format. Specifics on the expected format are described in ``ScriptInformation.txt``. Aside from the array dimensions, the script does not use information from the FITS headers, only the image data. If you find that none of the available options work for the format your data is in, you will need to make a new format and associated format code in ``pyirc.py`` (modifying the functions ``get_nside``\ , ``get_num_slices``\ , and ``load_segment`` all in the first part of ``pyirc.py``\ ).
#. Start with a simple version of the configuration, such as provided in example_config_wfirst_h4rg_18237. You will replace the two placeholder files in the LIGHT section with your flat files, and the ones in the DARK section with dark files. You will also change the FORMAT parameter to the format code that matches your data format as described in ``ScriptInformation.txt``. You may also need to adjust the TIME inputs depending on how many frames your files contain.
#. ``python test_run.py <yourconfigfile>``
#. Output files will appear in the directory specified in the OUTPUT line of the config.
