# Noise command has two arguments:
#  first is the noise mode
#  second is the input file
#
# Possible modes (must be all lower case):
#  'none' = do not include the noise (no need for file name)
#  'last' = add noise file to the last frame
#  'full' = add noise file to all frames
#  any other option here will add a small amount of Gaussian noise
